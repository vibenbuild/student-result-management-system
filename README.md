# Student Result Management System
This is a simple **Student Result Management System** built using MySQL. The project manages student data, course details, and academic results. It demonstrates how to perform basic database operations such as creating tables, inserting data, and executing queries to analyze and retrieve meaningful information.

## Features
- **Manage Students**: Add and view student details.
- **Manage Courses**: Add and view course details.
- **Track Results**: Record and analyze student performance in courses.
- **Queries for Insights**:
  - Get student grades for specific courses.
  - Calculate average marks for students.
  - Identify top-performing students.
  - List students scoring below a specific threshold.

## Technologies Used
- **Database**: MySQL
- **SQL Queries**: Basic and intermediate SQL operations

## How to Use
1. Create the database and tables by running the provided SQL script.
2. Insert sample data or add your own data into the `students`, `courses`, and `results` tables.
3. Run the queries to retrieve and analyze student performance data.

## File Structure
- `student_result_management.sql`: Contains the SQL script to create the database, tables, sample data, and queries.

## Example Queries
- View all students:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM students;
  ```
- Get grades for a specific student:
  ```sql
  SELECT s.name, c.course_title, r.grade, r.marks
  FROM results r
  JOIN students s ON r.student_id = s.student_id
  JOIN courses c ON r.course_id = c.course_id
  WHERE s.student_id = 1;
  ```
- Calculate average marks of a student:
  ```sql
  SELECT s.name, AVG(r.marks) AS average_marks
  FROM results r
  JOIN students s ON r.student_id = s.student_id
  WHERE s.student_id = 1;
  ```

## Future Improvements
- Add a front-end interface for easier interaction.
- Include GPA calculation for students.
- Expand the project to support APIs for integration with other systems.
